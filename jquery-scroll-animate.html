        <p>BERLIN: Emirates has had extensive discussions with Airbus about the production of a revamped version of the A380 super jumbo with more efficient engines, the airline's president said on Thursday.</p>

        <p>Emirates, which is the leading buyer of the existing A380 jet with 140 orders, has said it would look at placing an order for up to 200 A380neo jets to replace its current fleet and drive further expansion.</p>

        <p>"If we're lucky it will give us a 10-13 percent reduction in seat costs per mile," Emirates President Tim Clark told reporters at an event during the ITB travel fair in Berlin.</p>

        <p>"We understand they're compiling the business case and an element of that will be the Emirates order," Clark said.</p>

        <p>He said he expected an A380neo would be powered by Rolls-Royce engines based on its Trent XWB engine.</p>
